## Overview  

ICE for macOS is a next-generation clipboard enhancement tool that transforms the way users interact with copied content. Instead of relying on the system’s single-item clipboard, ICE maintains a rich and organized clipboard history that you can browse, filter, and restore instantly.  

Designed to run smoothly on Apple devices, ICE provides fast access to your copied texts, links, and images right from the menu bar. The interface is minimal yet functional, allowing users to manage their clipboard data without interrupting their current work. You can quickly locate any copied item through powerful keyword search or preview content directly before pasting.  

Advanced customization options let you decide how many items to retain, whether to automatically remove sensitive data, and how to group related clips. Users can assign hotkeys for faster actions or enable “favorites” for clips they frequently reuse.  

ICE is built for efficiency and privacy — all clipboard data remains stored locally, ensuring that no information ever leaves your system. It’s ideal for writers, designers, coders, and multitaskers who need quick recall and consistent access to frequently used snippets.  

By merging intelligence, simplicity, and privacy-first design, ICE becomes more than just a clipboard history app — it’s a daily productivity companion for macOS that helps you work smarter and faster every day.
